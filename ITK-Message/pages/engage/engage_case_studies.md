## Case Studies

Care Connect case studies provide examples of how real world problems have been solved using Care Connect. Following a process that shows how the project evolved from gathering business requirements through to the final creation of a solution, case studies offer insight and education from the experience of other trusts and service providers.

Case studies demonstrate the application of the [Care Connect Engagement Process](/engage).The outline of this process can be seen in the following diagram.

The development of the Care Connect standard relies on community engagement curated by INTEROPen. Contributions can be made, either by joining the INTEROPen or simply contacting INTEROPen using the email address careconnect@interopen.org.
