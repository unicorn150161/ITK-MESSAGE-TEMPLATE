{% include important.html content="This site is under active development by NHS Digital on behalf of INTEROPen and is intended to provide all the technical resources you need to successfully develop the Care Connect APIs. This project is being developed using an agile methodology so iterative updates to content will be added on a regular basis." %}

# Introduction #

The Care Connect RESTful APIs within this site have been developed collaboratively by NHS Digital and the INTEROPen community. These APIs aim to  better support the delivery of care by opening up information and data held across different clinical care settings through the use of nationally defined INTEROPen FHIR® resources.

The INTEROPen vision is to create a library of nationally defined HL7® FHIR® resources and interaction patterns that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within UK health and social care.

Find out more on the [INTEROPen website](http://interopen.org/).

# Using this guide #

This guide has been created to support the adoption of Care Connect profiles and FHIR resources. As such the site is structured around Care Connect stakeholders including API users, developers and architects.

The above steps outline a complete API journey from imagination and exploring to developing local APIs using Care Connect profiles all the way to deploying a live API.

# Care Connect Focus #

The current site focuses on a typical API Developer's Journey as highlighted by the green boxes below in the developer journey:

NHS Digital is contributing to progressing the profile developmenet, the testing process and invitations are open for the INTEROPen community to get involved and progress the wider developer ecosystem.

Please see the explanation of the complete development roadmap.

# Resource Roadmap #

The [API journey](overview_api_journey.html) outlines the development roadmap for the RESTful APIs outlined within this site.

<img src="images/roadmap/roadmap-online.png" style="width:100%;max-width: 100%;">

The above roadmap illustrates the steps necessary to create, test and verify the profiles as well as some of the supporting tooling which might be necessary to build to provide viable APIs. The roadmap is not intended to be complete but to promote discussion, extension and engagement from the INTEROPen community.
